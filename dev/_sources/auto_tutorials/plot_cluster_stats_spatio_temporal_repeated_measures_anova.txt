======================================================================
Repeated measures ANOVA on source data with spatio-temporal clustering
======================================================================

This example illustrates how to make use of the clustering functions
for arbitrary, self-defined contrasts beyond standard t-tests. In this
case we will tests if the differences in evoked responses between
stimulation modality (visual VS auditory) depend on the stimulus
location (left vs right) for a group of subjects (simulated here
using one subject's data). For this purpose we will compute an
interaction effect using a repeated measures ANOVA. The multiple
comparisons problem is addressed with a cluster-level permutation test
across space and time.

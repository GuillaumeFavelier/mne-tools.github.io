==============================================
Compute effect-matched-spatial filtering (EMS)
==============================================

This example computes the EMS to reconstruct the time course of
the experimental effect as described in:

Aaron Schurger, Sebastien Marti, and Stanislas Dehaene, "Reducing multi-sensor
data to a single time course that reveals experimental effects",
BMC Neuroscience 2013, 14:122


This technique is used to create spatial filters based on the
difference between two conditions. By projecting the trial onto the
corresponding spatial filters, surrogate single trials are created
in which multi-sensor activity is reduced to one time series which
exposes experimental effects, if present.

We will first plot a trials x times image of the single trials and order the
trials by condition. A second plot shows the average time series for each
condition. Finally a topographic plot is created which exhibits the
temporal evolution of the spatial filters.
